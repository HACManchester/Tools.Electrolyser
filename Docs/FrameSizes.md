The plan is to make it a max of 660mm high so that it fits under the bench (the bench underneath is about 670mm from the floor)

  * 2 x BasePlate  = 790mm x 470mm
  * 2 x SidePanel  = 566mm x 470mm
  * 1 x Shelfpanel = 754mm x 470mm
  * 1 x BackPlate  = 790mm x 100mm
  * 1 x SeperatorPlate = 290mm x 380mm
